# Employee Teams Generator

## Description
This application was built to generate profiles based on inputs from Node.js Inquirer Module. The information entered by the user is displayed on a generated HTML file. I built this application using Test Driven Development process, which led to multiple iterations as I had to create various test cases for the various functions to operate as expected. The application demonstrates the capabilities of Jest and Object Oriented Progamming (OOP) when building everyday-use applications.
